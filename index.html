  <h1>How U.S. College Students Use AI in 2025: A Quantitative Snapshot</h1>

  <p>By 2025, artificial intelligence has become a normalized part of U.S. college students' academic routines. AI adoption among students now exceeds 90%, spanning disciplines and tools—from writing assistants to visual generators and tutoring bots. This white paper provides a structured, data-backed look into the tools, trends, and attitudes shaping the AI-in-education landscape, segmented by major and use case.</p>

  <h2>AI Usage by Major</h2>
  <p>AI adoption varies across fields of study, reflecting differences in academic demands and digital fluency. In 2025, 62% of business majors, 59% of STEM students, and 52% of humanities majors report regularly using AI tools to complete coursework. STEM students tend to use AI for coding help and data analysis, while humanities students lean on writing and summarization tools.</p>

  <h2>Top AI Tools Used by Students</h2>
  <p>Writing assistants dominate AI usage. ChatGPT leads with 83% adoption among AI-using students, followed by Grammarly at 50%. Visual generators like DALL·E (17%) and Midjourney (15%) are popular for art and design majors. Meanwhile, chatbots like Bing Chat (11%) and Google Bard (8%) serve as homework and brainstorming aides.</p>

  <h2>AI Adoption Trend (2023–2025)</h2>
  <p>AI adoption has surged rapidly in three years. In 2023, around 66% of students had experimented with AI. By 2024, that number rose to 78%. As of 2025, 92% of students report some level of regular AI use, with many integrating it into daily academic habits like reading summarization, problem solving, or paper drafting.</p>

  <h2>Student Attitudes Toward AI</h2>
  <p>Student sentiment toward AI remains complex. 56% admit to using AI on assignments or exams, while 54% still believe some forms of use constitute academic dishonesty. Although 79% say instructors have discussed AI ethics in class, only 58% report that their program has a clearly defined AI policy. This gap between ethical guidance and institutional enforcement is a key friction point.</p>
